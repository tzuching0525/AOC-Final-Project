## Performance in CPU
Please fill in the number of execution cycles and the results from the Valgrind analysis.

**Scoring Criteria for every improved operation:**

| Cycles reduced ratio  | score | Note                  |
| -------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------- |
| <20%                             | 2.5%   | Basic implement score |
| 20%                              | 3.5%   |                   |

| 50%                              | 7.5%   |                   |

Cycle Reduction Ratio, defined as:
$$
\frac{\text{Cycle}_{\text{original}} - \text{Cycle}_{\text{improved}}}{\text{Cycle}_{\text{original}}}
$$

**❗Additional information:**
Since the number of D refs and D1 misses does not vary with the server's state, these values will be used as a reference during grading. The cycle count, however, will be evaluated with a more lenient standard.
