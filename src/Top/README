testbench: (2 type operation: (128*64)*(64), (64*128)*(128))
simulate DRAM as readmem, input data to GLB(SRAM) once 4 byte.
After 64*64*1byte weight, 64*1byte ifmap, 64*4byte bias are transfered to GLB, PE_array starts to compute (8*32)*(32) MVM.
Bias(ipsum) needs to be updated by opsum of former MVM output.
PE_array will compute 16 times (row first) MVM, and output 64 ofmaps to GLB.
Each type of operation needs two times (64*64)*(64) MVM.
For operation type 1 ((128*64)*(64)): 
Need to load bias twice.
Ofmap size is 128, output of MVM be stored in GLB.
After all 128 ofmaps are computed completely, ready to next step (PPU).
For operation type 2 ((64*128)*(128)): 
Need to load ifmap twice.
Ofmap size is 64, output of MVM becomes as bias(ipsum) of next MVM.

When whole linear operation done, transfer ofmaps to PPU in a row and recieved PPU output as compute result for a cycle delay.
and write the result back to DRAM.
